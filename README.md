## Techs:
This web app was built using **React**, initialized with the Create React App (CRA) template.
It also uses:
- **prop-types** to check the types of component props at runtime;
- **styled-components** to style.

## Get started:
- With Git installed, in your terminal run the following command: `git clone https://github.com/VitinhoSouza/jstack-mycontacts-web.git`;
- Open the terminal inside the project folder and do `yarn`. When all packages are installed, do `yarn start` to start in development mode;
- To work properly, you must have a server running and on the correct port listening for your requests (available at https://github.com/VitinhoSouza/jstack-mycontacts).
